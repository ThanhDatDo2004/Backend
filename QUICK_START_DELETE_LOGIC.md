# üöÄ Quick Start: Delete Field Logic

## What You Implemented

**Policy:**
- ‚úÖ CAN delete s√¢n if: NO future bookings OR all bookings PAST (qua h·∫°n)
- ‚ùå CANNOT delete s√¢n if: ANY future booking exists (ch∆∞a qua h·∫°n)

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: User clicks "X√≥a S√¢n"
```
DELETE /api/shops/me/fields/30
```

### Step 2: Backend checks
```typescript
const hasFuture = await fieldModel.hasFutureBookings(fieldCode);
if (hasFuture) {
  // ‚ùå Has future bookings ‚Üí BLOCK
  throw 409 Conflict
}
```

### Step 3: If no future bookings ‚Üí DELETE ALL
```
‚úÖ Delete Field_Images (Step 1)
‚úÖ Delete Field_Pricing (Step 2)
‚úÖ Delete Bookings (Step 3)      ‚Üê ALL bookings deleted
‚úÖ Delete Fields (Step 4)
```

### Step 4: Return success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "data": { "deleted": true },
  "message": "X√≥a s√¢n th√†nh c√¥ng"
}
```

## The Logic

### What is "FUTURE Booking"?

**FUTURE** (CAN'T DELETE):
- üìÖ PlayDate > today
- üìÖ PlayDate = today BUT EndTime > current_time
- Status = 'booked' or 'held'

**PAST** (CAN DELETE):
- üìÖ PlayDate < today
- üìÖ PlayDate = today AND EndTime < current_time
- Any status (completed, cancelled, etc.)

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Can Delete
```
Today: 2025-10-20 15:00

S√¢n 10:
‚îú‚îÄ Booking 1: 2025-10-18    ‚úÖ PAST
‚îú‚îÄ Booking 2: 2025-10-19    ‚úÖ PAST
‚îî‚îÄ Booking 3: 2025-10-20 12:00-14:00 (ended at 14:00)  ‚úÖ PAST

DELETE /api/shops/me/fields/10
‚Üí ‚úÖ 200 OK (Delete s√¢n + all bookings)
```

### Example 2: Can't Delete
```
Today: 2025-10-20 15:00

S√¢n 11:
‚îú‚îÄ Booking 1: 2025-10-19    ‚úÖ PAST
‚îî‚îÄ Booking 2: 2025-10-21    ‚ùå FUTURE (PlayDate > today)

DELETE /api/shops/me/fields/11
‚Üí ‚ùå 409 Conflict
‚Üí "S√¢n c√≥ ƒë∆°n ƒë·∫∑t trong t∆∞∆°ng lai, kh√¥ng th·ªÉ x√≥a."
```

### Example 3: Today but Not Finished
```
Today: 2025-10-20 15:00

S√¢n 12:
‚îî‚îÄ Booking: 2025-10-20 14:00-18:00  ‚ùå FUTURE
           (EndTime 18:00 > current 15:00)

DELETE /api/shops/me/fields/12
‚Üí ‚ùå 409 Conflict
```

## Code Files Changed

### File 1: `backend/src/models/field.model.ts`
- Added: `deleteAllBookingsForField()`
- Added: `hasAnyBookings()`
- Updated: `hasFutureBookings()` with better comments
- Updated: All methods with POLICY comments

### File 2: `backend/src/services/field.service.ts`
- Updated: `deleteFieldForShop()` with detailed comments
- Added: Comprehensive DELETION POLICY section
- Added: Step-by-step deletion sequence explanation

---

## Database Level

### Check Future Bookings
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Field_Slots
WHERE FieldCode = ?
  AND (
    PlayDate > CURDATE() OR 
    (PlayDate = CURDATE() AND EndTime > NOW())
  )
  AND Status IN ('booked', 'held')
```

### Delete All Bookings
```sql
DELETE FROM Bookings WHERE FieldCode = ?
```

---

## Test It

### Terminal 1: Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Terminal 2: Test

**Test 1: Delete field without future bookings**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5050/api/shops/me/fields/30 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Expected: ‚úÖ 200 OK
```

**Test 2: Try delete field with future bookings**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5050/api/shops/me/fields/31 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Expected: ‚ùå 409 Conflict
```

## Files to Review

1. **Logic Policy:** DELETION_POLICY_IMPLEMENTED.md
2. **Complete Summary:** FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY_ALL_FK.md
3. **Deletion Flow:** COMPLETE_DELETION_SEQUENCE.txt
4. **Code:** 
   - backend/src/models/field.model.ts (methods with comments)
   - backend/src/services/field.service.ts (deleteFieldForShop flow)

---

## Key Points

‚úÖ **Only checks FUTURE bookings** (not past)
‚úÖ **Deletes ALL bookings** (past + present when allowed)
‚úÖ **Respects FK constraints** (images ‚Üí pricing ‚Üí bookings ‚Üí field)
‚úÖ **Clear error message** (409 if future bookings found)
‚úÖ **No API changes** (same endpoint, same response format)

---

## What Happens When?

| Scenario | Check | Delete? | What Gets Removed |
|----------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| No bookings | - | ‚úÖ YES | Field, Images, Pricing |
| All past bookings | Future = false | ‚úÖ YES | Field, Images, Pricing, Bookings |
| 1+ future bookings | Future = true | ‚ùå NO | Nothing (409 error) |
