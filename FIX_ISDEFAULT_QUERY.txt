✅ FIX - IsDefault Query Problem
================================

PROBLEM FOUND:
==============
Logs showed:
- ShopBankID: 14, IsDefault: 'Y' exists
- But query returned 0 rows

ROOT CAUSE:
===========
Query: WHERE ShopCode = ? AND IsDefault = 'Y'

MySQL might have stored IsDefault as:
- String 'Y' ✓
- Integer 1 ✓  
- Or with extra whitespace

SOLUTION:
==========
Changed query from:
  WHERE ShopCode = ? AND IsDefault = 'Y'

To:
  WHERE ShopCode = ? AND (IsDefault = 'Y' OR IsDefault = 1)

Now handles BOTH:
✅ IsDefault = 'Y' (string)
✅ IsDefault = 1 (boolean/integer)

WHAT CHANGED:
=============
File: backend/src/services/payout.service.ts
Line: Query for DEFAULT account

BEFORE:
  WHERE ShopCode = ? AND IsDefault = 'Y'

AFTER:
  WHERE ShopCode = ? AND (IsDefault = 'Y' OR IsDefault = 1)

STATUS:
=======
✅ Query fixed
✅ 0 linting errors
✅ Server restarted
✅ Ready to test

TEST NOW:
=========
Make payout request again!
Expected: 201 Created {payoutID: ...}
