# âœ… Backend Fix Complete - PaymentStatus Logic

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Changed

### Problem
- Backend was checking `BookingStatus IN ('pending', 'confirmed')`
- This showed sÃ¢n as booked even if payment wasn't paid
- Logic was wrong

### Solution
- Changed to check `PaymentStatus = 'paid'`
- Now only blocks sÃ¢n when payment is confirmed
- Matches your requirements exactly

---

## ðŸ”§ Backend Changes

**File:** `backend/src/models/fieldQuantity.model.ts`

**Two methods fixed:**

1. **`getAvailableForSlot(fieldCode, playDate, startTime, endTime)`**
   - Returns courts NOT blocked by paid bookings
   - Uses `PaymentStatus = 'paid'` check

2. **`getBookedForSlot(fieldCode, playDate, startTime, endTime)`**
   - Returns courts blocked by paid bookings
   - Uses `PaymentStatus = 'paid'` check

---

## ðŸ“‹ Logic (Correct Flow)

### When User Selects Time Slot: 08:00-09:00, 2025-10-21

**Backend does:**
```
1. Find Field_Quantity for FieldCode = 68
   â†’ Get: QuantityID 22,23,24,25 (SÃ¢n 1,2,3,4)

2. Find paid bookings (PaymentStatus = 'paid')
   â†’ Get: QuantityID 23 with Field_Slots matching this time

3. Exclude booked from available
   â†’ Available: 22,24,25 (SÃ¢n 1,3,4)
   â†’ Booked: 23 (SÃ¢n 2)

4. Return:
   availableCount: 3
   availableQuantities: [SÃ¢n 1, 3, 4]
   bookedQuantities: [SÃ¢n 2]
```

## âœ… How It Works

### Scenario 1: Only 1 Court Paid-Booked
```
QuantityID 23 (SÃ¢n 2) has PaymentStatus = 'paid'
Result: Show SÃ¢n 1,3,4 as available âœ…
        Show SÃ¢n 2 as booked âœ…
```

### Scenario 2: All 4 Courts Paid-Booked
```
QuantityID 22,23,24,25 all have PaymentStatus = 'paid'
Result: availableCount = 0
        Frontend hides entire time slot âœ…
```

### Scenario 3: Only Pending Payment (Not Paid)
```
QuantityID 23 has PaymentStatus = 'pending'
Result: Show all 4 sÃ¢n as available âœ…
        (payment not confirmed, so don't block)
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Query Changes

### OLD (Wrong):
```sql
WHERE b.BookingStatus IN ('pending', 'confirmed')
AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Field_Slots fs ...)
```

### NEW (Correct):
```sql
INNER JOIN Field_Slots fs ON b.BookingCode = fs.BookingCode
WHERE b.PaymentStatus = 'paid'
AND fs.PlayDate = ?
AND fs.StartTime < ?
AND fs.EndTime > ?
```

**Why better:**
- Direct join with Field_Slots (faster)
- Checks PaymentStatus, not BookingStatus
- Time overlap logic is correct

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test 1: Single Paid Booking
```bash
# Setup: QuantityID 23 (SÃ¢n 2) with PaymentStatus = 'paid'

curl "http://localhost:5050/api/fields/68/available-quantities?playDate=2025-10-21&startTime=08:00&endTime=09:00" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

Expected Response:
{
  "availableCount": 3,
  "availableQuantities": [1, 3, 4],
  "bookedQuantities": [2]
}
```

### Test 2: All Paid Bookings
```bash
# Setup: All 4 courts with PaymentStatus = 'paid'

Same request

Expected Response:
{
  "availableCount": 0,
  "availableQuantities": [],
  "bookedQuantities": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
# Frontend completely hides this time slot
```

### Test 3: Only Pending (Not Paid)
```bash
# Setup: QuantityID 23 with PaymentStatus = 'pending'

Same request

Expected Response:
{
  "availableCount": 4,
  "availableQuantities": [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "bookedQuantities": []
}
# All courts available, payment not confirmed yet
```

## ðŸ”— API Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "fieldCode": 68,
    "playDate": "2025-10-21",
    "timeSlot": "08:00-09:00",
    "totalQuantities": 4,
    "availableCount": 3,
    "availableQuantities": [
      {"quantity_id": 22, "quantity_number": 1, "status": "available"},
      {"quantity_id": 24, "quantity_number": 3, "status": "available"},
      {"quantity_id": 25, "quantity_number": 4, "status": "available"}
    ],
    "bookedQuantities": [
      {"quantity_id": 23, "quantity_number": 2, "status": "available"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## âœ… Verification Checklist

- [x] Changed BookingStatus to PaymentStatus
- [x] Changed from EXISTS to INNER JOIN
- [x] Time overlap logic: StartTime < endTime AND EndTime > startTime
- [x] No syntax errors
- [x] Both methods updated

---

## ðŸš€ Deployment

1. **Restart Backend**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "npm run dev"
   sleep 2
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **No Database Migration Needed**
   - No schema changes
   - Only query logic changed

3. **Test with Postman**
   - Use provided collection
   - Verify PaymentStatus = 'paid' logic
