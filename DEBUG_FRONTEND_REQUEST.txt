üîç DEBUG: Frontend vs Postman
==============================

POSTMAN (WORKS - 201):
Request body:
{
  "amount": 500,
  "bank_id": 14,        ‚Üê SPECIFIC bank_id
  "password": "anhchang1",
  "note": "Test"
}

WEBSITE (FAILS - 500):
Response error:
"Kh√¥ng t√¨m th·∫•y t√†i kho·∫£n ng√¢n h√†ng"

POSSIBLE REASONS:
=================

1. Frontend NOT sending bank_id
   - bank_id = undefined
   - Backend converts to: bankId = undefined || 0 = 0
   - Searches for IsDefault = 'Y'
   - Finds ShopBankID: 15 (default)
   - But query still fails somehow

2. Frontend sending WRONG bank_id
   - bank_id = null
   - bank_id = ""
   - bank_id = "14" (string instead of number)
   - bank_id = 999 (doesn't exist)

3. Frontend sending null/undefined amount
   - amount = 0
   - amount = null
   - amount < balance

4. Password wrong
   - Different password than Postman

WHAT TO DO:
===========

Add debug logging in frontend to check what's being sent:

JavaScript/React:
---
const payload = {
  amount: 500,
  bank_id: 14,
  password: userPassword,
  note: "Test"
};

console.log('Payout request:', payload);
console.log('bank_id type:', typeof payload.bank_id);
console.log('bank_id value:', payload.bank_id);

fetch('/api/shops/me/payout-requests', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log('Response:', data));
---

THEN SHARE:
===========
1. Console logs showing:
   - bank_id type (should be "number")
   - bank_id value (should be 14 or similar)
   - Full request payload
   - Full response error

2. Network tab from DevTools:
   - Request body (what frontend sent)
   - Response (what backend returned)

3. Backend logs:
   - [Payout Controller] showing what was received
   - [Payout] showing what query was made

WITH THESE DETAILS I CAN FIX IMMEDIATELY!
