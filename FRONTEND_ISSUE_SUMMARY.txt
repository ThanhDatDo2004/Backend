🔴 ISSUE: Postman Works ✅ but Website Fails ❌
================================================

POSTMAN TEST:
POST /api/shops/me/payout-requests
{
  "amount": 500,
  "bank_id": 14,
  "password": "anhchang1",
  "note": "Test"
}
Response: 201 Created ✅

WEBSITE TEST:
Same endpoint from frontend form
Response: 500 Error ❌
"Không tìm thấy tài khoản ngân hàng"

ROOT CAUSE:
===========
Frontend form NOT sending same data as Postman!

Likely issues:
1. bank_id not being sent (undefined)
2. bank_id is string "14" instead of number 14
3. bank_id is null
4. amount is wrong
5. password is different

QUICK FIX:
===========

Check frontend code for payout form:

BEFORE (maybe):
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/shops/me/payout-requests', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount: formData.amount,
      password: formData.password,
      note: formData.note
      // Missing bank_id!
    })
  });
};

AFTER (should be):
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/shops/me/payout-requests', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount: parseInt(formData.amount),     // Ensure number
      bank_id: parseInt(formData.bank_id),   // Ensure number
      password: formData.password,
      note: formData.note
    })
  });
};

IMPORTANT:
- amount must be NUMBER > 0
- bank_id must be NUMBER (from bank list)
- password must be STRING (exact password)
- All fields must be included

TEST:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Submit form
4. Click the payout-requests request
5. Check Request body
6. Compare with Postman version

THEN SHARE:
- The Request body from DevTools
- bank_id value and type
- Full error message

I'LL FIX IT! 🔧
